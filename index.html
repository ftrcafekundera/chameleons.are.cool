<h1 class="fish">A few reasons why chameleons are cool</h1>
<p>Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their very extensive, highly modified, rapidly extrudable tongues; their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their brow and snout.</p>
<p>The family Chamaeleonidae was divided into two subfamilies, Brookesiinae and Chamaeleoninae, by Klaver and BÃ¶hme in 1986.</p>
